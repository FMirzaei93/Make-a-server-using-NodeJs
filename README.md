This is a simple project for running a server using Nodejs and doing some tasks.

In order for the server to get started, navigate to the folder of the project and run this command in terminal/cmd:

`$node index`

Then by calling `http://localhost:8888/` (or any other port that you specify in index.js file) in the browser, make the server start running.
